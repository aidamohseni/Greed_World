# Greed_World
This Python code defines an implementation of a simple game called "GreedWorld" using reinforcement learning. In this game, an agent navigates through a grid-world environment with the goal of reaching a winning state while avoiding a losing state. The code is written in Python and makes use of the NumPy library for numerical operations.
