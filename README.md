# Greed_World
This Python code defines an implementation of a simple game called "GreedWorld" using reinforcement learning. In this game, an agent navigates through a grid-world environment with the goal of reaching a winning state while avoiding a losing state. The code is written in Python and makes use of the NumPy library for numerical operations.

<h1>GreedWorld - Reinforcement Learning Game</h1>
<p>This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple reinforcement learning game called "GreedWorld." In this game, an agent navigates through a grid-world environment with the goal of reaching a winning state while avoiding a losing state. The code is written in Python and uses the NumPy library for numerical operations.</p>
<h2>Key Components</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grid Environment</li>
<ul>
<li>Grid size: 3 rows x 4 columns</li>
<li>Winning state: (0, 3)</li>
<li>Losing state: (1, 3)</li>
<li>Starting position: (2, 0)</li>
<li>Environment can be deterministic or stochastic</li>
</ul>
<li>State Class</li>
<li>Agent Class</li>
<li>Training</li>
<li>Results</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>You can use this code to explore reinforcement learning in a grid-world environment. To get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
<li>Run the Python script to train the agent and see the learned state values.</li>
</ol>
